# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on organizing and standardizing the infrastructure repository structure to maintain clear separation between Docker and Kubernetes deployments while ensuring both deployment methods can effectively manage the same applications and services. The goal is to create a well-structured, maintainable infrastructure-as-code repository that supports both containerized and orchestrated deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a clear separation between Docker and Kubernetes deployment configurations, so that I can choose the appropriate deployment method for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate the repository THEN I SHALL see distinct `docker/` and `k8s/` directories at the root level
2. WHEN I examine the directory structure THEN each deployment method SHALL have its own complete configuration files
3. IF I need to deploy an application THEN I SHALL be able to choose between Docker Compose or Kubernetes without configuration conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent application categorization across both Docker and Kubernetes deployments, so that I can easily locate and manage similar services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I browse application configurations THEN applications SHALL be categorized consistently (applications, databases, infrastructure, monitoring, storage, utilities)
2. WHEN I compare Docker and Kubernetes structures THEN the same categories SHALL exist in both deployment methods
3. IF an application exists in Docker THEN it SHALL have a corresponding Kubernetes configuration when applicable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized configuration management for environment variables and secrets, so that I can deploy applications securely across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy an application THEN environment variables SHALL be managed through appropriate mechanisms (.env files for Docker, ConfigMaps/Secrets for Kubernetes)
2. WHEN I configure secrets THEN sensitive data SHALL be handled securely in both deployment methods
3. IF I update configuration THEN changes SHALL be easily propagatable across environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want automated deployment scripts and management tools, so that I can efficiently deploy and manage infrastructure components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to deploy services THEN I SHALL have management scripts for both Docker and Kubernetes
2. WHEN I run deployment commands THEN the scripts SHALL handle dependencies and proper startup sequences
3. IF deployment fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want integrated monitoring and logging solutions, so that I can observe system health across all deployed services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN monitoring components SHALL be automatically configured
2. WHEN I access monitoring dashboards THEN I SHALL see metrics from all deployed applications
3. IF issues occur THEN logging systems SHALL capture and aggregate logs from all services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper network segmentation and access controls, so that services are isolated and secure by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN network policies SHALL enforce proper isolation
2. WHEN external access is needed THEN ingress/proxy configurations SHALL control access appropriately
3. IF services communicate THEN internal networking SHALL use secure protocols and authentication
